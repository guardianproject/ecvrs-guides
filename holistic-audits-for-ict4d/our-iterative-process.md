# Our Iterative Process

An iterative process is a way of working through a project by repeatedly refining and improving upon it through a series of cycles or iterations. In software development, this process is often used as a way to manage the complexity of creating large, complex software systems. Using an iterative process allows the team to focus on small, manageable chunks of work at a time, which helps to reduce the risk of errors and makes it easier to manage the complexity of the project. It also allows the team to gather feedback from stakeholders and users throughout the process, which can be used to refine and improve the project as it progresses.

Some of the guidelines we will follow to achieve this are:

1. Be transparent and engaged with all stakeholders through open systems and communication
2. Share results and outputs, early and often for feedback
3. Debrief and reflect upon the quality of outcomes and outputs, to inform, revise, and improve subsequent iterations of the work
