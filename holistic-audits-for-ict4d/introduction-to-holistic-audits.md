**Introduction/Executive Summary**

* Initial Takeaways
* Threat Analysis
* Information on the Solution/Product&#x20;

**Source Code Security Audit**

* Software Bill of Materials
* Test Environment
* Dug into known issues
* read application source code,&#x20;
* deployed a development instance as described in the projectâ€™s documentation,&#x20;
* deeply probed known problem areas in web applications.&#x20;
* Our testing and audit methodology was guided by the OWASP Web Security Testing Guidelines. [https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/)
* We also produced a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)&#x20;
* &#x20;performed a manual review of third-party dependencies.
