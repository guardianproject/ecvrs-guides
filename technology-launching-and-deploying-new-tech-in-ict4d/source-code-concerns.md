# Source Code Concerns

**Major Areas of Concern:**

* Lack of Automated and Manual Testing: Multiple sources mention the absence of both automated and manual testing in the source code, raising concerns about the robustness and reliability of the software.
* Unsanitized Query Inputs: Some query inputs are not sanitized or insufficiently sanitized, creating the possibility of SQL injection attacks.
* Hard-Coded Credentials: The source code contains hard-coded credentials, presenting a security risk.
* Inadequate Exception Handling: Exception handling is not properly configured for log auditing, reducing the chances of detecting intrusions and other errors.
* Supply Chain Attacks: The source code lacks measures to mitigate supply chain attacks, such as using tools to control access to dependencies.
* Unsafe Database Access: The application logs directly into the database instead of using a separate append-only microservice, allowing for manipulation of the log if attackers gain write access to the database.
* Unsafe Authentication Access: The application directly accesses the database of Keycloak, bypassing the security benefits of using Keycloak as an authentication microservice.
* Embedded Credentials and Proprietary Dependencies: Embedded credentials and proprietary dependencies in the Gradle build configuration elevate the risk of unauthorized access and manipulation.

**Recommendations to Mitigate:**

* Develop Manual Test Plans and Implement Automated Testing: Create manual test plans and implement automated testing to improve code quality and identify vulnerabilities.
* Sanitize All Query Inputs: Ensure all query inputs are properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Remove Hard-Coded Credentials: Eliminate hard-coded credentials from the source code to reduce security risks.
* Improve Exception Logging: Configure exception handling for proper log auditing to facilitate intrusion detection and error identification.
* Implement Defenses against Supply Chain Attacks: Employ tools and practices to control access to dependencies and mitigate supply chain attacks.
* Address Unsafe Database Access and Authentication Service Access: Establish a separate append-only microservice for database logging and avoid direct access to the Keycloak database to enhance security.
* Remove Embedded Credentials and Proprietary Dependencies: Eliminate embedded credentials and proprietary dependencies to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and manipulation.
