# Development and Secure Operations

* **Implement secure deployment practices.**
  * Ensure secure deployment practices, such as using encrypted connections, restricting access to sensitive data, and implementing strong authentication mechanisms.
* **Prioritize traffic protection.**
  * Implement robust security measures to protect against traffic manipulation and eavesdropping, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption and intrusion detection systems.
* **Develop comprehensive test plans.**
  * Create comprehensive test plans that cover various scenarios and use automated testing tools to thoroughly evaluate the system's functionality and performance.
* **Eliminate hard-coded credentials.**
  * Implement secure credential management practices, such as using secrets management tools and rotating credentials regularly.
* **Protect against supply chain attacks.**
  * Implement measures to protect against supply chain attacks, such as verifying the integrity of software updates and using a trusted software repository.
* **Remove embedded credentials and proprietary dependencies.**
  * Eliminate embedded credentials and migrate to open-source alternatives to reduce security risks and improve transparency.
* **Address database access and authentication service vulnerabilities.**
  * Implement secure database access controls, such as role-based access control and input validation, and ensure strong authentication mechanisms for authentication services.
* **Improve exception logging.**
  * Implement robust exception logging to capture and analyze errors, facilitating proactive problem resolution and enhancing system reliability.
* **Prioritize input sanitization.**
  * Implement rigorous input sanitization techniques to prevent malicious inputs from exploiting vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of the system.
